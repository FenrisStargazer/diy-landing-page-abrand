	<p>I'm not great at talking about myself so this is gonna be awful, but let's give it a go: I hate having my photo taken which is why my cat Legolas is modeling for this "profile pic" of sorts. I rather love web design/development and it's actually what drove me towards getting a degree in computer science. I hope to work in software design/development and/or web design/development someday but I'm not sure I have the confidence or social skills to manage either. Autumnal colors and Halloween vibes are my everything, even if I rarely get to use or have them in things. Uh... I don't know. Hope that's good enough. Oh and I'm lacking in buttons here because I don't really have any social media and can't think of what else to link to.</p>
